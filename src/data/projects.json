All products are developed in accordance with MMC standard operation procedures (SOP). MMC products support a risk-based assessment, prioritization and management framework for the USACE CIPR, WM, Dam Safety and Levee Safety Programs.  MMC Production Center efforts also provide the Risk Management Center (RMC) with critical feedback for refining and updating USACE guidance and policy within the MMC functional areas. The Jacksonville District Geomatics MMC team has been involved with the MMC Mapping Program since 2010 and continues to lead the mapping production effort."

Project features consist of 7.0 miles of channel improvements, 7.6 miles of levees, the replacement of 3 bridges, recreation facilities, and mitigation for the loss of environmental habitats. The Water Resources Development Act of 1990 authorized this project. RDLP Inundation Scenarios WMV compiles various storm flooding scenarios developed by EN-WH Hydraulic and Hydrology section in which shows flooding results for existing and with project completed conditions for a 100 year storm and Standard Project Flood (SPF). The flooding scenarios are used by various divisions under USACE JAX and other Districts to identify affected properties under the existing and with project conditions."
