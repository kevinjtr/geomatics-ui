All products are developed in accordance with MMC standard operation procedures (SOP). MMC products support a risk-based assessment, prioritization and management framework for the USACE CIPR, WM, Dam Safety and Levee Safety Programs.  MMC Production Center efforts also provide the Risk Management Center (RMC) with critical feedback for refining and updating USACE guidance and policy within the MMC functional areas. The Jacksonville District Geomatics MMC team has been involved with the MMC Mapping Program since 2010 and continues to lead the mapping production effort."
