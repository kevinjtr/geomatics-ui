          Survey
        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
        Survey services include the collection, analysis, and interpretation of topographic/hydrographic, boundary, geodetic, subsurface utilities, construction, and aerial surveys. Field work is largely accomplished via architect-engineer (A-E) services in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer Act and acquisition regulations.

          Remote Sensing
        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
        Remote sensing is a vital technology used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to collect and analyze data about the Earth's surface from a distance. By employing advanced sensors on satellites, aircraft, and unmanned aerial systems, we can obtain detailed imagery and information crucial for infrastructure planning, environmental management, and disaster response.

          GIS
        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
        Geographic Information Systems are computer-based software tools that allow users the ability to analyze, store, map, model, and display data (whether in vector or raster format) related to geographic positions on the Earthâ€™s surface.

          Data Management/Database Development
        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
        Data management is the practice of collecting, keeping, and using data securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively. The primary purpose of designing a database is to produce physical and logical models of designs for the proposed database system.

      These components work together seamlessly: remote sensing identifies areas of interest, GIS analyzes and visualizes the data, applications/software aids in analysis, and survey data validates remote sensing information. Efficient data management integrates and makes information accessible across the organization. Together, GIS, remote sensing, data management, software development, and survey/contracting enable the Geomatics section (EN-DG) to provide engineering solutions supporting national security, environmental sustainability, and economic development for the US Army Corps of Engineers.
